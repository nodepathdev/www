          related applications, and other services provided by us and on which a
          link to this Terms of Service is displayed (collectively, together the

          agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of that Organization, which is
          the &ldquo;Subscriber&rdquo; under this Agreement, and you represent
          and warrant that you have the authority to bind such Organization to

          intellectual property rights;</p><p>(c) post, upload, or distribute
          any content that is unlawful, defamatory, libelous, inaccurate, or
          that a reasonable person could deem to be objectionable, profane,
          indecent, pornographic, harassing, threatening, embarrassing, hateful,
          or otherwise inappropriate;</p><p>(d) collect, manage, or process
          Sensitive Information. &ldquo;Sensitive Information&rdquo; means
          credit or debit card numbers; personal financial account information;

          Websites</u>. Nodepath provides tools that enable the automatic export
          and sync of information to third-party services, including features
          that allow Subscriber to connect the Subscriber&rsquo;s account with
          an account on the third-party platform. By using these tools,
          Subscriber agrees that we may transfer such information to the
          applicable third-party service. Such third-party services are not
          under our control, and we are not responsible for their use of
          Subscriber&rsquo;s exported information.</p><p>3.5 <u>Ownership;
          Proprietary Rights</u>. The Nodepath Services are owned and operated
          by Nodepath. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation,
          information, data, computer code (including source code or object
          code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the
          Nodepath Services (the &ldquo;<strong>Materials</strong>&rdquo;)
          provided by Nodepath are protected by all relevant intellectual
          property and proprietary rights and applicable laws. All Materials
          contained in the Nodepath Services are the property of Nodepath or its
          third-party licensors. Except as expressly authorized by Nodepath,
          Subscriber may not make use of the Materials. Nodepath reserves all
          rights to the Materials not granted expressly in this
          Agreement.</p><p>3.6 <u>Feedback</u>. If Subscriber provides any
          feedback to Nodepath concerning the functionality or performance of
          the Nodepath Services (including identifying potential errors or
          improvements), Subscriber hereby grants to Nodepath a perpetual,
          irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferrable, royalty-free, worldwide
          license (with right to grant sublicenses through multiple tiers) in
          and to the feedback, and Nodepath is free to use the feedback without
          payment or restriction.</p><p><strong>4. FEES AND
          PAYMENT</strong></p><p>4.1 <u>Fees and Payment Terms</u>. To use the
          Nodepath Services, Subscriber must pay all applicable fees. You will
          have an opportunity to review and accept any fees by executing a
          Service Order, or as part of Nodepath&rsquo;s online checkout process.
          All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-cancelable and
          non-refundable. Unless otherwise agreed by Nodepath, all fees must be
          paid in advance of the subscription period by credit card.</p><p>(a)
          <u>Authorization</u>. Subscriber authorizes Nodepath to charge all
          sums for the orders that Subscriber makes and any level of Nodepath
          Services you select as described in this Agreement or published by
          Nodepath, to the payment method specified in your account.</p><p>(b)
          <u>Subscription Service</u>. Paid accounts may require automatic
          recurring payments. The subscription will continue unless and until
          you cancel or we terminate it. You must cancel before it renews in
          order to prevent billing for the subsequent period. We will bill the
          subscription to the payment method you provide to us during
          registration (or to a different method if you change it). You may
          cancel a subscription in your account settings.</p><p>(c)
          <u>Delinquent Accounts</u>. Nodepath may suspend or terminate access
          to the Nodepath Services for any account for which any amount is due
          but unpaid.</p><p>4.2 <u>Taxes</u>. Other than net income taxes
          imposed on Nodepath, Subscriber will bear all taxes, duties, and other
          governmental charges (collectively, &ldquo;taxes&rdquo;) resulting
          from this Agreement.</p><p><strong>5. TERM AND
          TERMINATION</strong></p><p>5.1 <u>Term</u>. This Agreement will
          commence upon the Effective Date and continue for the initial term
          specified when in Subscriber&rsquo;s Service Order or online checkout
          process, unless it is terminated earlier in accordance with the terms
          of this Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed by Nodepath, this Agreement
          will automatically renew for additional successive terms of equal
          length to the initial term unless at least 30 days before the end of
          the then-current term either party provides written notice to the
          other party that it does not want to renew.</p><p>5.2 <u>Termination
          by Subscriber</u>. Subscriber may terminate this Agreement at any time
          by canceling Subscriber&rsquo;s account via the account settings
          tab.</p><p>5.3 <u>Termination of Use; Discontinuation and Modification
          of the Nodepath Services</u>. Nodepath may suspend your access to the
          Nodepath Services or terminate this Agreement, in its sole discretion,
          at any time if: (a) you breach this Agreement; (b) you misuse the
          Nodepath Services; or (c) allowing you to access or use the Nodepath
          Services would violate any applicable local, state, federal or other
          laws, rules and regulations, or would expose Nodepath to legal
          liability. We will use reasonable efforts to provide you notice of any
          such suspension or termination. You agree that Nodepath shall not be
          liable to you or any third-party for any such suspension or
          termination.</p><p>5.4 <u>Post-Termination Obligations</u>. Upon
          termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) Subscriber&rsquo;s
          license rights will terminate and Subscriber must immediately cease
          all use of the Nodepath Services; (b) Subscriber will no longer have
          access to its account; (c) Subscriber must pay Nodepath any unpaid
          amount that was due prior to termination; and (d) all payment
          obligations accrued prior to termination and Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.5,
          3.6, 4, 5.4, 6.2, and 7 through 12 and all other sections which by
          their nature should survive.</p><p><strong>6. WARRANTIES AND
          DISCLAIMER</strong></p><p>6.1 <u>Subscriber Warranties</u>. Subscriber
          represents and warrants to Nodepath that: (a) Subscriber will comply
          with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in connection with
          its use of the Nodepath Services; (b) Subscriber has all rights and
          licenses necessary (including with respect to any and all third-party
          platforms used by Subscriber in connection with the Nodepath Services)
          for Nodepath to provide the Nodepath Services to Subscriber and to
          otherwise grant the rights granted to Nodepath under this Agreement;
          (c) Subscriber has the right to consent to the use of the Nodepath
          Services on behalf of all users of the Nodepath Services through
          Subscriber&rsquo;s account; and (d) no manual, policy, contract or
          other documentation of Subscriber creates any expectation of privacy
          or contains any statements or terms in any way contrary to
          Subscriber&rsquo;s and its Authorized Users&rsquo; use of the Nodepath
          Services contemplated in this Agreement, and no user of the Nodepath
          Services through Subscriber&rsquo;s account, has an expectation
          contrary to the use of the Nodepath Services contemplated in this
          Agreement.</p><p>6.2 <u>Disclaimer</u>. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS
          REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES STATED IN THIS SECTION 6, Nodepath
          MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHETHER EXPRESS,
          IMPLIED (EITHER IN FACT OR BY OPERATION OF LAW), OR STATUTORY, AS TO
          ANY MATTER. Nodepath EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
          MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUALITY, ACCURACY,
          TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Nodepath DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST
          INTERFERENCE WITH THE ENJOYMENT OF THE Nodepath SERVICES. Nodepath
          DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE Nodepath SERVICES ARE ERROR-FREE OR THAT
          OPERATION OF THE Nodepath SERVICES WILL BE SECURE OR UNINTERRUPTED.
          Nodepath DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE
          Nodepath SERVICES IS ACCURATE OR COMPLETE OR THAT ANY INFORMATION
          PROVIDED THROUGH THE Nodepath SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE.
          Nodepath EXERCISES NO CONTROL OVER AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY
          LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF
          SUBSCRIBER&rsquo;S USE OF THE Nodepath SERVICES.</p><p><strong>7.
          INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT</strong></p><p>7.1 <u>Defense of
          Infringement Claims</u>. Nodepath will, at its expense, either defend
          Subscriber from or settle any claim, proceeding, or suit
          (&ldquo;<strong>Claim</strong>&rdquo;) brought by a third-party
          against Subscriber alleging that Subscriber&rsquo;s use of the
          Nodepath Services infringes or misappropriates any intellectual
          property right during the term of this Agreement if: (a) Subscriber
          gives Nodepath prompt written notice of the Claim; (b) Subscriber
          grants Nodepath full and complete control over the defense and
          settlement of the Claim; (c) Subscriber provides assistance in
          connection with the defense and settlement of the Claim as Nodepath
          may reasonably request; and (d) Subscriber complies with any
          settlement or court order made in connection with the Claim (e.g.,
          relating to the future use of any infringing Nodepath Services).
          Subscriber will not defend or settle any Claim without
          Nodepath&rsquo;s prior written consent. Subscriber will have the right
          to participate in the defense of the Claim with counsel of its own
          choosing, but Nodepath will have sole control over the defense and
          settlement of the Claim.</p><p>7.2 <u>Indemnification of Infringement
          Claims</u>. Nodepath will indemnify Subscriber from and pay (a) all
          damages, costs, and attorneys&rsquo; fees finally awarded against
          Subscriber in any Claim Nodepath defends pursuant to Section 7.1; (b)
          all out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees)
          reasonably incurred by Subscriber in connection with the defense of a
          Claim under Section 7.1 (other than attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs
          incurred without Nodepath&rsquo;s consent after Nodepath has accepted
          defense of the Claim); and (c) all amounts that Nodepath agrees to pay
          to any third-party to settle any Claim under Section 7.1.</p><p>7.3
          <u>Exclusions from Obligations</u>. Nodepath will have no obligation
          under this Section 8 for any infringement or misappropriation arising
          out of or based upon (a) use of the Nodepath Services in combination
          with other products or services if such infringement or
          misappropriation would not have arisen but for such combination; (b)
          use of the Nodepath Services by Subscriber for purposes not intended
          or outside the scope of the license granted to Subscriber; (c)
          Subscriber&rsquo;s failure to use the Nodepath Services in accordance
          with instructions provided by Nodepath, if the infringement or
          misappropriation would not have occurred but for such failure; or (d)
          any modification of the Nodepath Services not made or authorized in
          writing by Nodepath where such infringement or misappropriation would
          not have occurred absent such modification.</p><p>7.4
          <u>Mitigation</u>. If the Nodepath Services become, or in
          Nodepath&rsquo;s reasonable opinion are likely to become, the subject
          of an infringement claim, Nodepath may, at its sole option and
          expense, either (a) procure for Subscriber the right to continue
          exercising the rights granted to Subscriber in this Agreement, (b)
          replace or modify the applicable item of the Nodepath Services so that
          it becomes non-infringing and remains functionally equivalent, or (c)
          terminate this Agreement and the licenses granted hereunder; except,
          that Nodepath is not obligated to take any such action, or any
          corrective or similar action, in respect of the Nodepath Services
          pursuant to this Agreement.</p><p>7.5 <u>Limited Remedy</u>. This
          Section 7 states Nodepath&rsquo;s sole and exclusive liability, and
          Subscriber&rsquo;s sole and exclusive remedy, for the actual or
          alleged infringement or misappropriation of any third-party
          intellectual property right by the Nodepath Services.</p><p><strong>8.
          SUBSCRIBER INDEMNIFICATION</strong></p><p>8.1 <u>Defense</u>.
          Subscriber will defend Nodepath from any actual or threatened
          third-party Claim arising out of or based upon (a) Subscriber&rsquo;s
          misuse or improper use of the Nodepath Services; or (b)
          Subscriber&rsquo;s breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
          (c) Subscriber&rsquo;s negligent or intentional misconduct. Nodepath
          will: (i) give Subscriber prompt written notice of the Claim; (ii)
          grant Subscriber full and complete control over the defense and
          settlement of the Claim; (iii) provide assistance in connection with
          the defense and settlement of the Claim as Subscriber may reasonably
          request; and (iv) comply with any settlement or court order made in
          connection with the Claim. Nodepath will have the right to participate
          in the defense of the Claim at its own expense and with counsel of its
          own choosing, but Subscriber will have sole control over the defense
          and settlement of the Claim.</p><p>8.2 <u>Indemnification</u>.
          Subscriber will indemnify Nodepath from and pay (a) all damages,
          costs, and attorneys&rsquo; fees finally awarded against Nodepath in
          any Claim under Section 9.1; (b) all out-of-pocket costs (including
          reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) reasonably incurred by Nodepath in
          connection with the defense of a Claim under Section 8.1 (other than
          attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs incurred without Subscriber&rsquo;s
          consent after Subscriber has accepted defense of the Claim); and, (c)
          all amounts that Subscriber agrees to pay to any third-party to settle
          any Claim under Section 8.1.</p><p><strong>9. LIMITATIONS OF
          LIABILITY</strong></p><p>9.1 <u>Disclaimer of Indirect Damages</u>.
          NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT,
          NO PARTY WILL, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY
          FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING
          OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST
          PROFITS OR LOSS OF BUSINESS, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY IS APPRISED OF THE
          LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES OCCURRING.</p><p>9.2 <u>Cap on
          Liability</u>. EXCEPT FOR THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER
          SECTION 7 AND SECTION 8, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL EITHER
          PARTY&rsquo;S TOTAL LIABILITY OF ALL KINDS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED
          TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTY CLAIMS),
          REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM
          IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID
          BY SUBSCRIBER TO Nodepath DURING THE 12 MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING
          THE CLAIM (DETERMINED AS OF THE DATE OF ANY FINAL JUDGMENT IN AN
          ACTION).</p><p>9.3 <u>Independent Allocations of Risk</u>. EACH
          PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF
          LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO
          ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS
          ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN THE PRICING OFFERED BY Nodepath TO
          SUBSCRIBER AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN
          BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND
          INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE LIMITATIONS
          IN THIS SECTION 9 WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL
          PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT.</p><p><strong>10.
          DATA</strong></p><p>10.1 <u>Collection of Platform User Data</u>.
          Subscriber agrees and acknowledges that (a) the Nodepath Services
          automatically log all user activity conducted on the Nodepath
          Services, and (b) except for any Subscriber Data, Nodepath owns all
          right, title and interest in and to this data (&ldquo;<strong>Services
          Use Data</strong>&rdquo;). Nodepath will not publicly disclose any
          Services Use Data in a manner that would reasonably likely identify
          Subscriber as being the source of such Services Use Data.</p><p>10.2
          <u>User Data</u>. Subscriber owns all right, title and interest in and
          to the User Data. &ldquo;User Data&rdquo; means any data or
          information provided by Subscriber or accessed by Nodepath, in
          connection with Subscriber&rsquo;s use of the Nodepath Services.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, Nodepath receives from Subscriber a
          perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide right and license to
          access, process, store, and otherwise use anonymous, de-identified
          data (i.e., in a form that cannot be used itself to identify
          Subscriber or an individual) for any lawful purpose, including
          benchmarking, aggregate data scoring services, and validation
          services.</p><p>10.3 <u>Privacy Policy</u>. Please read the Nodepath
          Privacy Policy carefully for information relating to our collection,
          use, storage and disclosure of Subscriber&rsquo;s personal
          information. The Nodepath Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by

          <u>Additional Terms</u>. Subscriber&rsquo;s use of the Nodepath
          Services is subject to any and all additional terms, policies, rules,
          or guidelines applicable to the Nodepath Services or certain features
          of the Nodepath Services that Nodepath may post on or link to on the
          Nodepath Services (the &ldquo;<strong>Additional
          Terms</strong>&rdquo;), such as rules applicable to particular
          features or content on the Nodepath Services. All such Additional
          Terms are hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of,
          this Agreement.</p><p><strong>11. PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p><p>Please
          read the Nodepath Privacy Policy (available at <a
          href="https://lean20.com/legal/privacy-policy.html">https://nodepath.app/legal/privacy-policy.html</a>)for
          information relating to our collection, use, storage and disclosure of
          Subscriber&rsquo;s personal information. The Nodepath Privacy Policy
          is hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, this

          INFORMATION</strong></p><p>Both Parties will retain in confidence all
          information disclosed by the other party that is designated at the
          time of disclosure as proprietary or confidential (&ldquo;Confidential
          Information&rdquo;). Contact Data is Subscriber&rsquo;s Confidential
          Information. Pricing information and product roadmap information is
          Nodepath&rsquo;s Confidential Information. Confidential Information
          does not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally known
          to the public through no fault of or breach of this Agreement; (b) is
          rightfully known at the time of disclosure without an obligation of
          confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by either party
          without use of or reference to Confidential Information; or (d) is
          rightfully obtained from a third-party without restriction on use or
          disclosure.</p><p><strong>13. GENERAL</strong></p><p>13.1
          <u>Relationship</u>. Nodepath will be and act as an independent
          contractor (and not as the agent or representative of Subscriber) in
          the performance of this Agreement.</p><p>13.2 <u>Assignability</u>.
          Neither party may assign its right, duties, and obligations under this
          Agreement without the other party&rsquo;s prior written consent, which
          consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that a
          party may assign this Agreement without the other party&rsquo;s
          consent to a successor (including a successor by way of merger,
          acquisition, sale of assets, or operation of law) if the successor
          agrees to assume and fulfill all of the assigning party&rsquo;s
          obligations under this Agreement.</p><p>13.3 <u>Subcontractors</u>.
          Nodepath may utilize a subcontractor or other third-party to perform
          its duties under this Agreement so long as Nodepath remains
          responsible for all of its obligations under this
          Agreement.</p><p>13.4 <u>Force Majeure</u>. Neither party will be
          liable for, or be considered to be in breach of or default under this
          Agreement on account of, any delay or failure to perform as required
          by this Agreement as a result of any cause or condition beyond its
          reasonable control, so long as that party uses all commercially
          reasonable efforts to avoid or remove the causes of
          non-performance.</p><p>13.5 <u>Governing Law</u>. This Agreement will
          be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance
          with the local laws of the State of Washington, U.S.A., without
          reference to its choice of law rules and not including the provisions
          of the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
          Goods. Subscriber and Nodepath agree to submit to the personal and
          exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located
          within King County, Washington for the purpose of litigating all such
          disputes.</p><p>13.6 <u>Waiver</u>. The waiver by either party of any
          breach of any provision of this Agreement does not waive any other
          breach. The failure of any party to insist on strict performance of
          any covenant or obligation in accordance with this Agreement will not
          be a waiver of such party&rsquo;s right to demand strict compliance in
          the future, nor will the same be construed as a novation of this
          Agreement.</p><p>13.7 <u>Severability</u>. If any part of this
          Agreement is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the
          remaining portions of this Agreement will remain in full force and
          effect. If any material limitation or restriction on the use of the
          Nodepath Services under this Agreement is found to be illegal,
          unenforceable, or invalid, Subscriber&rsquo;s right to use the
          Nodepath Services will immediately terminate.</p><p>13.8
          <u>Interpretation</u>. The headings appearing at the beginning of
          several sections contained in this Agreement have been inserted for

          &ldquo;hereto,&rdquo; and words of similar import are used in this
          Agreement, they will be deemed references to this Agreement as a whole
          and not to any particular Article, Section or other provision hereof.
          The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is used in the inclusive sense of
          &ldquo;and/or.&rdquo; The terms &ldquo;or,&rdquo; &ldquo;any&rdquo;

          https://nodepath.app.</p><p>13.11 <u>Entire Agreement</u>. This
          Agreement (including each Service Order) is the final and complete
          expression of the agreement between these parties regarding
          Subscriber&rsquo;s use of the Nodepath Services. This Agreement
          supersedes, and the terms of this Agreement govern, all previous oral
          and written communications regarding these matters, all of which are
          merged into this Agreement, except that this Agreement does not
          supersede any terms explicitly added to each Service Order, or any
          prior nondisclosure or comparable agreement between the parties
          executed prior to this Agreement being executed. No employee, agent,
          or other representative of Nodepath has any authority to bind Nodepath
          with respect to any statement, representation, warranty, or other
          expression unless the same is specifically set forth in this
          Agreement. No usage of trade or other regular practice or method of
          dealing between the parties will be used to modify, interpret,
          supplement, or alter the terms of this Agreement. Nodepath will not be
          bound by, and specifically objects to, any term, condition, or other
          provision that is different from or in addition to this Agreement
          (whether or not it would materially alter this Agreement) that is
          proffered by Subscriber in any receipt, acceptance, confirmation,
          correspondence, or otherwise, unless Nodepath specifically agrees to
          such provision in writing and signed by an authorized agent of
          Nodepath.</p><h6><strong><em>Last modified
