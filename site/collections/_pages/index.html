      - question_text: Isn't this just a CRM?
        answer_text: >-
          CRMs are built for business; Nodepath is built for people. There is no leadgen, sequencing, or marketing, or pipeline. With Nodepath, you build connectons; not sales.
      - question_text: How are you different?
        answer_text: >-
          Nodepath is being built from the ground up to help you remember details about the connections in your life; while other solutions are more like a digital address book.
      - question_text: Do you support teams?
        answer_text: >-
          Yes, small teams will be supported
      - question_text: Is my data safe?
        answer_text: >-
          <strong>Yes.</strong> Data privacy is important. It will never be sold or shared. Your data belongs to you. You will be able to export or delete it anytime you want.
      - question_text: I still don't get it
        answer_text: >-
          <div>Let's say you are a startup founder. Maybe you are meeting with potential investors for the second time and you want to make a good impression.</div>
          <div style="margin-top: 12px;">The first time went well, and one of them told you about an upcoming vacation. Another had mentioned their son's last soccer game of the year. </div>
          <div style="margin-top:12px;">Using Nodepath, you could log these details and quickly look them up before the meeting starts. Remembering details of a person shows you care and can leave a lasting impression.</div>
