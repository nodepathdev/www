    questions:
      - question_text: How much does this cost?
        answer_text: >-
          There will be a free tier for inviduals, and a paid tier for small teams. Sorry, we don't have any specifics yet.
      - question_text: Who is this for?
        answer_text: >-
          Nodepath is for anyone who needs a system to help keep track of the connections in their life.
      - question_text: Isn't this just a CRM?
        answer_text: >-
          CRMs are built for business; Nodepath is built for people. We don't have any leadgen, sequences, or marketing fluff. We like to think of it as a Personal Relationship Manager (or PRM).
      - question_text: Is my data safe?
        answer_text: >-
          <strong>Yes.</strong> We are comitted to keeping your data safe. It will never be sold or shared. Your data belongs to you. You will be able to export or delete it anytime you want.
      - question_text: I still don't get it
        answer_text: >-
          <div>Let's say you are a startup founder. Maybe you are meeting with potential investors for the second time and you want to make a good impression.</div>
          <div style="margin-top: 12px;">The first time went well, and one of them told you about an upcoming vacation. Another had mentioned their son's last soccer game of the year. </div>
          <div style="margin-top:12px;">Using Nodepath, you could log these details and quickly look them up before the meeting starts. Remembering details of a person shows you care and can leave a lasting impression.</div>
