From a commercial and economic point of view, both types of transactions generally result in the consolidation of assets and liabilities under one entity, and the distinction between a “merger” and an “acquisition” is less clear. A transaction legally structured as a merger may have the effect of placing one party’s business under the indirect ownership of the other party’s shareholders, while a transaction legally structured as an acquisition may give each party’s shareholders partial ownership and control of the combined enterprise. A deal may be euphemistically called a “merger of equals” if both CEOs agree that joining together is in the best interest of both of their companies, while when the deal is unfriendly (that is, when the management of the target company opposes the deal) it may be regarded as an “acquisition”.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://unsplash.it/960/350?image=617\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"350\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"acquisition\">Acquisition</h3>\n\n<p>An acquisition or takeover is the purchase of one business or company by another company or other business entity. Such purchase may be of 100%, or nearly 100%, of the assets or ownership equity of the acquired entity. Consolidation occurs when two companies combine to form a new enterprise altogether, and neither of the previous companies remains independently. Acquisitions are divided into “private” and “public” acquisitions, depending on whether the acquiree or merging company (also termed a target) is or is not listed on a public stock market. Some public companies rely on acquisitions as an important value creation strategy. An additional dimension or categorization consists of whether an acquisition is friendly or hostile.</p>\n\n<p>Achieving acquisition success has proven to be very difficult, while various studies have shown that 50% of acquisitions were unsuccessful. “Serial acquirers” appear to be more successful with M&amp;A than companies who only make an acquisition occasionally (see Douma &amp; Schreuder, 2013, chapter 13). The new forms of buy out created since the crisis are based on serial type acquisitions known as an ECO Buyout which is a co-community ownership buy out and the new generation buy outs of the MIBO (Management Involved or Management &amp; Institution Buy Out) and MEIBO (Management &amp; Employee Involved Buy Out).</p>\n\n<p>The combined evidence suggests that the shareholders of acquired firms realize significant positive “abnormal returns” while shareholders of the acquiring company are most likely to experience a negative wealth effect. The overall net effect of M&amp;A transactions appears to be positive: almost all studies report positive returns for the investors in the combined buyer and target firms. This implies that M&amp;A creates economic value, presumably by transferring assets to management teams that operate them more efficiently (see Douma &amp; Schreuder, 2013, chapter 13).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://unsplash.it/960/350?image=864\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"350\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"business-valuation\">Business valuation</h3>\n\n<p>The five most common ways to value a business are</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>asset valuation,</li>\n  <li>historical earnings valuation,</li>\n  <li>future maintainable earnings valuation,</li>\n  <li>relative valuation (comparable company and comparable transactions),</li>\n  <li>discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Professionals who value businesses generally do not use just one of these methods but a combination of some of them, as well as possibly others that are not mentioned above, in order to obtain a more accurate value. The information in the balance sheet or income statement is obtained by one of three accounting measures: a Notice to Reader, a Review Engagement or an Audit.</p>\n\n<p>As synergy plays a large role in the valuation of acquisitions, it is paramount to get the value of synergies right. Synergies are different from the “sales price” valuation of the firm, as they will accrue to the buyer. Hence, the analysis should be done from the acquiring firm’s point of view. Synergy-creating investments are started by the choice of the acquirer, and therefore they are not obligatory, making them essentially real options. To include this real options aspect into analysis of acquisition targets is one interesting issue that has been studied lately.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a

Subscriber&rsquo;s use of the Nodepath Services is subject to any and all additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Nodepath Services or certain features of the Nodepath Services that Nodepath may post on or link to on the Nodepath Services (the &ldquo;<strong>Additional Terms</strong>&rdquo;), such as rules applicable to particular features or content on the Nodepath Services. All such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, this Agreement.</p><p><strong>11. PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p><p>Please read the Nodepath Privacy Policy (available at <a href=\"https://lean20.com/legal/privacy-policy.html\">https://nodepath.app/legal/privacy-policy.html</a>)for information relating to our collection, use, storage and disclosure of Subscriber&rsquo;s personal information. The Nodepath Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, this Agreement.</p><p><strong>12. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</strong></p><p>Both Parties will retain in confidence all information disclosed by the other party that is designated at the time of disclosure as proprietary or confidential (&ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo;). Contact Data is Subscriber&rsquo;s Confidential Information. Pricing information and product roadmap information is Nodepath&rsquo;s Confidential Information. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault of or breach of this Agreement; (b) is rightfully known at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by either party without use of or reference to Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third-party without restriction on use or disclosure.</p><p><strong>13. GENERAL</strong></p><p>13.1 <u>Relationship</u>.

Neither party may assign its right, duties, and obligations under this Agreement without the other party&rsquo;s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that a party may assign this Agreement without the other party&rsquo;s consent to a successor (including a successor by way of merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or operation of law) if the successor agrees to assume and fulfill all of the assigning party&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement.</p><p>13.3 <u>Subcontractors</u>. Nodepath may utilize a subcontractor or other third-party to perform its duties under this Agreement so long as Nodepath remains responsible for all of its obligations under this Agreement.</p><p>13.4 <u>Force Majeure</u>. Neither party will be liable for, or be considered to be in breach of or default under this Agreement on account of, any delay or failure to perform as required by this Agreement as a result of any cause or condition beyond its reasonable control, so long as that party uses all commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove the causes of non-performance.</p><p>13.5 <u>Governing Law</u>. This Agreement will be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance with the local laws of the State of Washington, U.S.A., without reference to its choice of law rules and not including the provisions of the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Subscriber and Nodepath agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within King County, Washington for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p><p>13.6 <u>Waiver</u>. The waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement does not waive any other breach. The failure of any party to insist on strict performance of any covenant or obligation in accordance with this Agreement will not be a waiver of such party&rsquo;s right to demand strict compliance in the future, nor will the same be construed as a novation of this Agreement.</p><p>13.7 <u>Severability</u>. If any part of this Agreement is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the remaining portions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. If any material limitation or restriction on the use of the Nodepath Services under this Agreement is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, Subscriber&rsquo;s right to use the Nodepath Services will immediately terminate.</p><p>13.8 <u>Interpretation</u>. The headings appearing at the beginning of several sections contained in this Agreement have been inserted for identification and reference purposes only and must not be used to construe or interpret this Agreement. Whenever required by context, a singular number will include the plural, the plural number will include the singular, and the gender of any pronoun will include all genders. Any reference to any agreement, document or instrument will mean such agreement, document or instrument as amended or modified and in effect from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof. Whenever the words &ldquo;include&rdquo;, &ldquo;includes&rdquo; or &ldquo;including&rdquo; are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words &ldquo;without limitation.&rdquo; Whenever the words &ldquo;hereunder,&rdquo; &ldquo;hereof,&rdquo; &ldquo;hereto,&rdquo; and words of similar import are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed references to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section or other provision hereof. The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is used in the inclusive sense of &ldquo;and/or.&rdquo; The terms &ldquo;or,&rdquo; &ldquo;any&rdquo; and &ldquo;either&rdquo; are not exclusive.</p><p>13.9 <u>Consent to Electronic Communications</u>. By using the Nodepath Service, Subscriber consents to receiving certain electronic communications from Nodepath as further described in its Privacy Policy.

This Agreement supersedes, and the terms of this Agreement govern, all previous oral and written communications regarding these matters, all of which are merged into this Agreement, except that this Agreement does not supersede any terms explicitly added to each Service Order, or any prior nondisclosure or comparable agreement between the parties executed prior to this Agreement being executed. No employee, agent, or other representative of Nodepath has any authority to bind Nodepath with respect to any statement, representation, warranty, or other expression unless the same is specifically set forth in this Agreement. No usage of trade or other regular practice or method of dealing between the parties will be used to modify, interpret, supplement, or alter the terms of this Agreement. Nodepath will not be bound by, and specifically objects to, any term, condition, or other provision that is different from or in addition to this Agreement (whether or not it would materially alter this Agreement) that is proffered by Subscriber in any receipt, acceptance, confirmation, correspondence, or otherwise, unless Nodepath specifically agrees to such provision in writing and signed by an authorized agent of Nodepath.</p><h6><strong><em>Last modified
